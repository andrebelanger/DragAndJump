			<h1><em>Drag and Jump</em></h1>
			
			<section>
				<h2>High Concept</h2>
				<p>A 2D platformer where the player makes (some of) the platforms!</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Genre</h2>
				<p>Puzzle-Platformer</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Story</h2>
				<p>Like most platformers, the story will be fairly simple. The player's goal is to reach the exit gate at the top of each level as fast as possible.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Esthetics</h2>
				<p>Graphics style - Very simple, with basic shapes and pixel art akin to Bit.Trip Runner.</p>
				<p>Sound - For the building phase, ambient 8-bit (think FEZ OST), with a faster paced techno version for the platforming phase.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Gameplay</h2>
				<h3>Mechanics</h3>
				<p>Each level will take up the entire canvas screen, meaning the 'camera' will remain static. Levels will consist of a few platforms and formations, 
				as well as pre-set starting locations for the player and level gate. Before the player begins the level, they have the ability to create a limited amount of
				platforms to aid them in platforming.</p>
				
				<h3>Control</h3>
				<h4>Drag (Building) Phase</h4>
				<p>The player can create rectangular platforms by clicking and dragging from the rectangle's origin point to its endpoint, similar to highlighting areas on the desktop
				of most OSes. The amount of platforms that can be drawn will be limited based on the platforms size. Drawn platforms can be deleted by clicking on them and pressing the
				delete key.</p>
				<h4>Jump (Platforming) Phase</h4>
				<p>Controls during platforming will be similar to most other web-based platformers. WASD for player movement, with the 'SPACE' key used for jumping.</p>
				
				<h3>Teaching the game</h3>
				<p>For the initial prototypes, an instructions screen detailing the game mechanics and controls will be accessible from the main menu. In future versions, an optional tutorial
				level will be implemented to allow the player to learn by doing, instead of reading.</p>
				<h3>Player learning</h3>
				<p>The main challenge of the game is trying to figure out the limitations of the player-character's platforming abilities, and drawing platforms in appropriate places
					in order to reach the exit gate as quickly and as efficiently as possible, as the player will be graded based on their completion time and the amount of platforms
					drawn. Over-reliance on drawing platforms as well as longer finish times will adversely affect the player's score.

				<h2>Issues With Current Version</h2>
				<p>
					Currently, player vs platform collision is a little wonky, and it's very easy to have the
					player jump up from the side of a platform and be immediately carried to the top. Another
					weakness this current version has is that it's a little bare bones as far as art goes. While
					I did originally plan to have a simpler art style, had I had more time I would have focused on
					making a more eyecatching background, animation for the player, and perhaps a tileset for platforms.
					Some missing gameplay elements that I also did not have time for was the implementation of the timer
					during the Jump Phase, so player performance is not being graded. ANother possible extension to my
					project is adding in stage hazards (such as the spikes shown in the mockups) or moving platforms with
					different shapes. There is only so much you can do with static, rectangular platforms, so adding in some
					different obstacles for the player would provide some much needed variety.

				<h2>About the developer</h2>
				<p>I'm Andre Belanger, a 4th-year Game Design and Development major, and my skill set leans towards programming, specifically with User Interface Design. While I have
					had JavaScript experience with a previous internship and other courses, this will be the first game project I have had involving JavaScript.</p>
